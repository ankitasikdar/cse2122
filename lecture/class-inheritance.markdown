One of the most powerful features of C++ is the use of *derived classes*.
The word inheritance is just another name for the topic of derived classes.

Inheritance allows us to define a generic class and then later define more specialized classes that add some new details to the existing general class.

Imagine we're writing a game. We'll need "data structures"
(collections of variables) to represent player characters (PCs; the
characters controlled by humans), non-player characters (NPCs; the
enemies that are part of the game), and physical objects (weapons,
crates, stairs, etc.). We could do this with basic classes:

{% highlight cpp %}
class Object
{
public:
    int weight;
    int position_x;
    int position_y;
};

class Weapon
{
public:
    int damage;
    int weight;
    string success_msg; // e.g. "the arrow hit!"
    string failure_msg; // e.g. "the arrow missed!"
};

class Player
{
public:
    int position_x;
    int position_y;
    int health;
    int strength;
    string name;
    Weapon *current_weapon;
    int id; // tells us which human is controlling which player
};

class Enemy
{
public:
    int position_x;
    int position_y;
    int health;
    int strength;
    string name;
    Weapon *current_weapon;
    int strategy_id; // what kind of AI (e.g. aggressive, friendly, etc.)
};
{% endhighlight %}

Good so far. Now we need functions. We want players and enemies to
move around, to fight each other; we want to determine which
objects/players/enemies are present at some position, etc. Here are
some function headers:

{% highlight cpp %}
void walk_one_step_player(Player* p, int direction);
void walk_one_step_enemy(Enemy* e, int direction);
void attack_enemy(Player* p, Enemy* e);
void attack_player(Enemy* e, Player* p);
{% endhighlight %}

Etc.

Since we're using classes, we can actually put the functions *inside*
the respective classes and get rid of the first parameter (the
pointer):

{% highlight cpp %}
class Player
{
public:
    int position_x;
    int position_y;
    int health;
    int strength;
    string name;
    Weapon *current_weapon;
    int id; // tells us which human is controlling which player
    
    void walk_one_step(int direction);
    void attack_enemy(Enemy* e);
    void attack_player(Player* p);
};

class Enemy
{
public:
    int position_x;
    int position_y;
    int health;
    int strength;
    string name;
    Weapon *current_weapon;
    int strategy_id; // what kind of AI (e.g. aggressive, friendly,
    etc.)
    
    void walk_one_step(int direction);
    void attack_enemy(Enemy* e);
    void attack_player(Player* p);
};
{% endhighlight %}

Because enemies, players, objects, and so on are distinct classes, we
have lots of specific functions. But these classes have a lot of
commonalities. Players and enemies are nearly the same thing except
for just a few differences. What if, instead, we could say "a player
is a kind of 'agent,' and an enemy is a kind of agent, and agents are
a kind of 'object' or 'thing'..."

This is what "object orientation" in general offers.

## Classes and inheritance

We really want a player to be a "kind of" agent and an agent a "kind
of" object. This is called "inheritance." We can diagram it like so
(in "UML" format):

![Class diagram (no member functions)](/cse2122/images/class-diagram-no-methods.png "Class diagram [no member functions]")

The arrows mean that a class *inherits* properties from the parent
class (what an arrow points to). So a Player automatically has the
properties `health`, `strength`, and so on from the Agent class, and
has `position_x` and so on from the Object class.

We could redefine the functions above in order to work on instances of
the Object class, instances of the Agent class, and so on. Typically,
we put functions inside the classes themselves. (And we call typically
them "member functions" when we do that, rather than "functions.") So our
diagram now shows member functions as well:

![Class diagram (with member functions)](/cse2122/images/class-diagram-methods.png "Class diagram [with member functions]")

Classes inherit member functions as well as properties. So the Player class
automatically has access to the member function `walk_one_step()`, which comes
from the Agent class.

## Why inheritance?

Without inheritance, we had to write functions like
`walk_one_step_player()` and `walk_on_step_enemy()`, or alternatively,
if we put the functions inside the classes, we had to write the
function `walk_one_step()` twice (for the `Player` and `Enemy` classes
each). Either way, there is duplication.

This is unfortunate because players and enemies are very much alike;
in fact, the two classes have many of the same data members (internal
data): `int position_x` and `int position_y` in particular. This means
that the code for the `walk_one_step_player()` function and the code
for the `walk_one_step_enemy()` function or both class-specific
`walk_on_step()` functions will be identical! These functions will
change the `position_x` and/or `position_y` values of the player or
enemy class.

Well sheesh, isn't there some way to write a single function that
works on both players and enemies, so we don't have to repeat code?

In order to write just one function, we have tell the compiler that
players and enemies are going to share code. The way we do this is we
create a parent class `Agent` that has the `walk_one_step()` member function.
We'll have the new `Player` and `Enemy` classes "inherit" the
data members `position_x` and `position_y` from the `Agent` parent
class; they will also inherit the member function `walk_one_step()`.

## How to use class member functions

Ok, now that we have the right hierarchy for Players and Enemies, we
need to figure out how to use the `walk_one_step()` function for some
particular player or enemy.

Let's create a player:

{% highlight cpp %}
Player me;
{% endhighlight %}

Now set its position:

{% highlight cpp %}
me.position_x = 5;
me.position_y = 9;
{% endhighlight %}

(Notice that we set data members just like we did when we used
structures.)

Since a player is an agent and agents have a `walk_one_step()` member function,
we can use it on the player called `me`:

{% highlight cpp %}
me.walk_one_step(0); // 0 means walk North
{% endhighlight %}

We use a member function on a class variable (called variously an "instance" or
an "object") in the same we that we get or set data members. That is to
say, we put the class variable or object first (`me`) then a dot
(`me.`) then the member function name like a normal function call
(`me.walk_one_step(0)`).

This is not how we use the functions at the top of these lecture notes;
those functions were defined outside of the classes and thus needed a
parameter that was a pointer to a class object:

{% highlight cpp %}
Player me;
me.position_x = 5;
me.position_y = 9;
walk_one_step_player(&me, 0);
{% endhighlight %}

But not now that we are using classes:

{% highlight cpp %}
Player me;         // same as above
me.position_x = 5; // same as above
me.position_y = 9; // same as above
me.walk_one_step(0); // different
{% endhighlight %}

Since `walk_one_step()` is now a class member function, it has to be called "on an
object" (the `me` before the dot). The code inside the member function can just refer to
data members `position_x` and `position_y` without using a pointer.

Let's compare. Here is the function:

{% highlight cpp %}
// walk_one_step_player() function
void walk_one_step_player(Player* p, int direction)
{
    if(direction == 0) // North
    {
        p->position_y = p->position_y - 1;
    }
    else if(direction == 1) // South
    {
    //...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now for the member function version:

{% highlight cpp %}
// walk_one_step() class member function
void walk_one_step(int direction)
{
    if(direction == 0) // North
    {
        position_y = position_y - 1;
    }
    else if(direction == 1) // South
    {
    //...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The variable `position_y` in the code above (the second example, the
member function) doesn't seem to exist (it's not a parameter and it's not
created in the member function). So how do we know what `position_y` refers to?
Recall that a Player inherits the member `int position_y` from the
Agent class. And recall that the `walk_one_step()` member function is being
called from a Player variable (object) called `me`:

{% highlight cpp %}
me.walk_one_step(0);
{% endhighlight %}

This means that `position_y` in the member function is the `position_y` of the
`me` object.
