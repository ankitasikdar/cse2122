In Class we discussed about the 'Stack' data structure( remember that it is LIFO 'last in first out'). A stack can be implemented using arrays or a linked list. In this homework, I want you to implement a Stack using linked lists.
In esscence you will have to implement the following functions:

* isEmpty: Return true if the stack is empty. 
* Top:  Access the top element.
* Push: Add a new element and update the TOP
* Pop: Remove element and update teh TOP
* Print: print all the elements in a stack

You may assume that the stack contains only integers. Look at the code for Linked List for a good starting point.
You must provide a command line based user interface. Remember to use top instead of first.
